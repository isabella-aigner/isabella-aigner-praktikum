                    <p>A little girl happy as the world could be<br>
                        was wandering around the world to see<br>
                        whatever lies beyond an horizon as which<br>
                        was lying ahead of her – and she whished<br>
                        for all creatures of the world to be friends<br>
                        with no bad feelings and ill intents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day she met a small little one<br>
                        frightened, weak and all alone.<br>
                        He was lying on a flowerbed<br>
                        with no way to go anymore ahead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He told her that he would die very soon<br>
                        because he was told so by the man in the moon.<br>
                        He couldn‘t change this fact at all<br>
                        so he was prepared for his big fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The girl turned sad and wanted to cry<br>
                        for a creature she didn‘t know yet to die<br>
                        was sadlier than sad and so tears were shed<br>
                        and the little girl couldn‘t tell anymore what would lie ahead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The small little one said that it was alright<br>
                        that his time would come that very night.<br>
                        He looked into the girls teary eyes<br>
                        and smiled in a kind and mysterious wise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the girl said she wanted to help him so bad<br>
                        that she didn‘t care anymore what would lie ahead.<br>
                        She wanted to become acquainted to him<br>
                        that she didn‘t mind if she became grim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The little one lying on the flowerbed said<br>
                        that he was happy with what he once had<br>
                        but if the girl wanted to help him that much<br>
                        there would be a way to save him as such.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His name was Elir the girl knows today<br>
                        a fairy of a land that lies far away.<br>
                        She welcomed the little one into her heart<br>
                        so that they will never be ever apart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that very moment their souls became one<br>
                        and nothing else could be anymore done.<br>
                        The girl herself became one of his kind<br>
                        leaving her past and everything else behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now she sets out on a journey through pedals and mud<br>
                        struggling, fighting and pushing forward.<br>
                        She is trying to find that far away place<br>
                        which became her reason of living instead.
